# **R**(ust)**ed**(itor)

Red is a clone of the famous Ed file editor from UNIX.

Without Ed, No Ex

Without Ex, No Vi

Without Vi, No Vim

Without Vim, No Good Code.

## Current state

Unfinished... It's already "usable" but not fully compatible with the original Ed. I'll update it slowly, but I'll do it.

## Build && Installation

- Clone the repo
- Enter the cloned repo folder
- `cargo install --path .`

## Did you wrote this README.md with Red ?

Yes. Yes I did.

And I also do update it with Red.

## This Rust code is horrible...

Yeah I know, that's my first (and maybe last) "real" Rust program. Don't blame me and do pull request if it's required.

## Special Thanks
